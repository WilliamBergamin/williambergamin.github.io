# Dynamic Resume

## What

This Dynamic Resume is a presonal website that is generated dynamicly from a JSON object that contains resume information. It can easily be deployed to github pages.

## Why

Software developers are known to be lazy. This why I have made this tool. With very little effort I can update the website.

## Who should use it

This project was made for me, I am not expecting anyone to use it. But if you want go ahead. All you need to do is update the resume.js file and change le links to your github and linkedIn.
